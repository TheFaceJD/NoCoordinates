The mod for new versions of Minecraft, removes the information about the player's position and direction from the Debug Menu, adding it when holding a compass.

An default compass works only in the overworld, a recovery compass works in all other worlds.

Thus, the game becomes more challenging and interesting, and the usage of the compass increases.
